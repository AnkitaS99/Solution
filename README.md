# Coding Test Solutions

**Language Used:** C Programming Language

**Reasoning** : 
I chose C because it's straightforward, fast, and great for practicing core programming logic. C gives you full control over how the program works, without too many shortcuts or extra features getting in the way. It’s a clean way to show the basic loops, conditions, input/output and it runs easily on almost any computer. It's also a language I'm extremely comfortable with and feel like I've mastered it.
